# Weather-app
## Description
Welcome to my custom built weather app! Below is an image of how the site should look upon loading propery. You'll see when you enter a city name that the search is appended below and results populat for the current temperature, wind-speed, and humidity. Below that, a five day weather forcast for that same city will appear. Please enjoy!
